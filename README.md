# Maze-Cocos2Dx
Maze is a 2-player cross-platform game designed using Cocos2D-x, where Player1 &amp; Player2 have been seperated in a labrynith. Player1 has been poisoned and needs to get a magic healing potion from Player2 within 10s to survive. The labrynith is a 13x13 maze with only one possible route between the players. If the two characters can meet on time, the game generates another maze with the same size and time-limit. In case of failure, the game ends. Player2 can be controlled with A,W,S &amp; D keys and Player1 can be controlled with Arrow Keys.
